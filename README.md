This is a hobby project: An advent calendar for family and friends with daily quiz questions.

I've programmed the app to run independently in the future. With Sanity CMS, questions can be added to each year, including answer options and audio files.

I am using Supabase and Next.js for auth and to keep track of users and their scores, which get displayed in a ranking for each year.
